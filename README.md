# odin-recipes
Project 1, HTML document featuring a few recipes.
End of coding HTML files,figuring out how to upload them to GitHub. 

Created 3 HTML files each containing recipes, images and all link to a home page. Each file contains a relative link to the index.html page. 

Eventually got all the files from this project onto the GitHub website after several attempts. Next project remember to commit more often for the code updates to make more sense.
